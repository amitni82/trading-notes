## Important indicators

| Indicator | Importance |
|--|--|
| Volume  | 1. Denotes **`INTENSITY`**  of price action <br> 2. Confirms if any BO/BD is strong/genuine or not.<br>3. More the volume, more the people with you.|
| EMA | 1. Denotes **`MOOD`** of market participants. <br> 2. ASTA uses 5, 13 and 26 EMA. <br> 3. **5** = days in week, **13** = days in fortnight, **26** = days in month <br> 4. 50 EMA is usually considered as `trend indicator` as well. <br> 5. Positive crossovers (PCO) of 5-13-26 indicate bullish sentiment.<br> 6. Negative crossovers (NCO) of 5-13-26 indicate bearish sentiment.|
| MACD | 1. Denotes **`TREND`**. <br> 2. ASTA uses default settings (12,26,close,9) <br> 3. `MACD line` is 12EMA-26EMA. `Signal line` is 9MA of the MACD line. <br> 4. PCO of MACD line over signnal line indicates bullish trend.<br> 5. NCO of MACD line over signnal line indicates brearish trend. <br> 6. ASTA uses the `direction/slope` of the MACD line to determine the trend. <br> 7. MACD is a `lagging indicator`.|
| STOCHASTIC | 1. Denotes **`SENTIMENT`** of market participants.  <br> 2. ASTA uses `(14,3,3)` setting and oscillator boundaries are `80` and `20`. <br> 3. Blue line is K line (stochastic line) whereas red line is D-Line (signal line) <br> 4. PCO of blue line over red line denotes buy signal <br> 5. NCO of blue line over red line denotes buy signal <br> 6. STO > 80 = `Overbought zone` <br> 7. STO < 20 = `Oversold zone` <br> 8. STO is a `leading indicator`.|
| RSI| 1. Denotes **`STRENGTH`** of the price action. <br>2. RSI> 60 = `Bullish momentum` <br> 3. RSI < 40 = `Bearish momemtum` <br> 4. RSI is a `leading indicator`. |

## DOW theory application to charts

1. For an uptrend, price needs to make `Higher High` (HH) and `Higher Low` (HL).
1. For an downtrend trend, price needs to make `Lower High` (LH) and `Lower Low` (LL).

## Oscillator divergences

1. Price movement and indicator movement `diverge` from each other i.e. go in opposite direction.
1. We look for divergences  shown by RSI and/or STO.
1. Divergence shown in the `oversold` and `overbought` regions are stronger.
1. Divergences help in identifying reversals earlier than the price. They help in `top fishing` and `bottom fishing`
1. Divergence in the oscillator can be a horizontal line too.
1. Divergence shown in the central region of the oscillator are also valid, but the ones shown in the overbought and oversold regions are stronger.


| Divergence |  Initial trend | Price making  | Oscillator making  | Where to look |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Bullish | Down | Equal or Lower Low  | Higher Low | At the lows |
| Bearish | Up | Equal or Higher High | Lower High | At the tops |
