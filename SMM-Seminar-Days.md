## Stock selection

Always trade stocks from NIFTY50.

You should always find an outperformers from a sector and trade those.

**Ghoda stock** : Continuously in overall uptrend (above 50EMA on monthly TF)
**Gadha stock** : Continuously in overall downtrend (below 50EMA on monthly TF)
**Khechar stock** : Continuously moving up and down or sideways trend (hovers around 50EMA on monthly TF)

1. Long a ghodha  when sentiments are negative (STO reaches Oversold region) - `Buy on dips`
1. Short a gadha when sentiments are positive (STO reaches Overbought region) -  `Sell on bounce`

**Always trade on selected few stocks so that you will know their history in and out. Treat them like a pet animal.**

### Selecting a ghoda stock

1. Check what sector is a ghoda by looking at movement of the  `sector index` w.r.t 50EMA on monthly TF.
  (go to horse's staple when you want to buy a horse)
1. After you identify a `ghoda sector`, start finding a ghoda stock in that sector.
1. Check all stocks that constituent the sector index and see how they are performing against 50EMA on monthly TF. Choose the ones who are better amongst the others.
1. Amongst the selected stocks from previous steps, compare them visually (can apply DOW theory, comparative retracement etc) to find out the best amongst them `outperformer / unicorn`.

1. Check what sector is a gadha by looking at movement of the  `sector index` w.r.t 50EMA on monthly TF.

## Time frames

| Psychology | Tide | Wave |
|--|--|--|
| Long term investor | Yearly | Monthly |
| Short term Investor | Monthly | Weekly |
| Positional trader | Weekly | Daily |
| Intraday | Daily | Hourly |
| Intraday | Hourly | 15min |
| Scalper  | 15min  | 5min  |

1. Freshers should begin with Daily as their wave.
1. Always wait for a sideway trend to turn into either uptrend or downtrend.
1. Avoid timeframe smaller than 15min since they contain `noise`.


## Trendlines

1. Support and resistances are guarded by bulls and bears respectively.
1. Significant points in drawing the TLs are those where there's a strong reversal
1. S&R, TLs - `longer` the bigger significance, `flatter` the bigger impact.
1. Horizontal TLs are more important and they get honored very often.
1. TLs on the higher TF are more significant.
1. S&Rs often act as R&S once broken.
1. Trendline are your friends.
1. BO/BD of a long time TL has a great significance and larger rewards.
1. A BO/BD usually `retests` the earlier break point.
1. You should always have TLs drawn at least on your wave and tide.

## News

1. Good news take prices up.
1. Bad news take prices down.
1. For commodities - price goes up when supply reduces and vice-a-versa.
1. Usually PA comes before the news because big players know the news in advance and get out earlier.
1. If you are not comfortable with the news, then don't trade on that day.

**When you trade an instrument, you MUST know about the important events like budget, annual report etc**

| News | PA | Context | Action |
|--|--|--|--|
| Good | Good | At bottom: Buy <br> At top: Avoid buying | Alert: Don't be aggressively bullish. |
| Good | Bad | Near top | Sell |
| Bad | Good | Near bottom | Buy |
| Bad | Bad | At top: Sell <br> At bottom: Avoid selling | Alert: Don't be aggressively bearish. |

## Weapon, confirmation, targets

1. Weapon is candle / candlestick-pattern / chart-pattern which denotes a continuation or reversal in your direction of your view.
1. Weapon decides the `Stoploss` and hence is very important.  `Weapon मिला तो trade मिला `
1. Volume confirms how much loaded is the weapon. `बंदूक की गोलियां`.
1. TLBO/BD is a significant event. You will not see chart patterns everyday.
1. If the weapon is for the BO/BD, it should have greater than average volume.
1.  Confirmation candle should close above/below the high/low of your weapon based on your trade direction <br>**e.g**. For a hanging man (HM), the confirmation candle should close below the HM's low.
1. Confirmation candle need not be the immediate candle after the weapon.
1. Target can be based on the <br>a. Chart pattern<br>b. S&Rs <br>c. Fib retracement levels
1. When target T1 is achieved, book profit and wait for next target.
1. If your weapon is big, then you can apply Fib retracement to it for refining the entry.

## Stoploss

1. Stoploss is associated with your weapon. If your weapon is gone, you need to move out of the trade.
1. `Technical SL` - A price level which changes the view completely e.g. low of morning star
1. `My SL` -  A conservative SL based on my RRR e.g. median of morning star


## Oscillator zones

Stochastic  > 80 : Overbought zone `Office` <br>
20 < Stochastic  < 80 : `On the way` <br>
Stochastic  < 20 : Oversold zone `Home` <br>

`Best place to short` -> Office : Overbought zone <br>
`Best place to long`  -> Home : Oversold zone
